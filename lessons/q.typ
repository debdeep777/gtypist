T:			Welcome to lesson Q1.
 :
 :In the Q series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

#                                                              ../orig/q.typ:42
T:
 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Above the D-key is the E-key.  Above the K-key is the I-key.  Learn these
 :positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your fingers and
 :make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them again.

*:_Q_R_L2
#                                                              ../orig/q.typ:63
T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.
