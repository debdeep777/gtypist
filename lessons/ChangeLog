	as suggested by José Pelegrín <josepl@acm.org>.

	* d.typ, r.typ, v.typ, esp.typ: remove more occurrences of "Q:
	Press Y to continue, ..."  following an exercise (because this is
	builtin since 2.4)
	* d.typ, v.typ, r.typ: remove all occurrences of "Q: Press Y to
	cont..." following T: : It doesn't make sense to repeat a T:, the
	standard message "Press Enter to continue." is better
	
	* d.typ: There was such an I: command:
I:Juvenile zest for excitement whetted interest in parking by the quay.
	(and a D: command was missing in the paragraph). changed this to D:.

	* ?.typ: adapt lessons to new 2.4 syntax
