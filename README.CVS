Notes on how to build it from CVS 
=================================

(UNIX only)


REQUIREMENTS
------------

First, make sure you ever want to do it.  Remember, there are stable releases,
and they work nicely.

If you do, then check if you have automake-1.8.2 and autoconf 2.57 properly
installed on your system (check 'autoconf --version' and 'automake --version').
You may try it with different versions, but we don't know if they work.

Other requirements include:
	* GCC (any reasonable version, 3.3.x is recommended) and libc headers
	  (of course they must match the libc);
	* GNU make (any reasonable version, 3.80 will do);
	* ncurses 5.3.2 (or any reasonable version) library and headers
	  (of course they must match the library too);
	[add other requirements here].


BUILDING
--------

Figure out which options you wish to pass to the configuration script, and pass
them as parameters to the `autogen.sh' script.  Unfortunately, to
get the entire list of them, you have to invoke './configure --help', and get
this script before with 'aclocal; automake --add-missing; autoconf'.  Just don't
bother about it, most of the people use standard settings.
Also set $CC, $CFLAGS and $LDFLAGS to desired values, if you wish.

If you are going to install it not system-wide, supply `--prefix=[DIR]' to the
`autogen.sh', where [DIR] is directory where you are going to install the
gtypist (e.g. if you have no root, you may want to use `--prefix=$HOME').

Run `autogen.sh' and examine its output for possible errors.  Since this is CVS
version, it may even not build correctly.  If you are sure that you have done
everything right and our scripts are buggy, mail description of your problem
to bug-gtypist mailing list <bug-gtypist@gnu.org>.

Note that autogen.sh will produce even more than you probably need, for example,
tarballs of the source distribution.  Just ignore everything that you are not
interested in.


INSTALLATION
------------

Run `make install'.  Of course, you have to have necessary acces rights at the
time (e.g. if you install it system wide, you have to run it as root).


UNINSTALLATION
--------------

If you still have the same sources with the same configuration settings,
you can simply `make uninstall'.  If not, then go to `--prefix'
(/usr/local by default) with which you have done the installation and
delete the files manually.
