	* gtypist.c: Bug fix: added "break;" for "--scoring" case

	* gtypist.c: Added switch for "characters-per-minute" mode.  This
	  is pretty much cosmetic since "words" are standardized to 5
	  characters, but some countries tend to use CPM instead of WPM.
	  However, speeds will top out at 999.99 CPM (200 WPM).
