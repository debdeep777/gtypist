	* gtypist.[ch], infoview.c: don't show beginner screen when --expert is given,
	when the user presses 'D'/'d' in beginner screen: write option "expert"
	into config file.

2012-07-08 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c, utf8.[ch]: Avoid collision between 0x107 unicode char
	  (c with accent) and KEY_BACKSPACE by honoring the return value
	  of get_wch() (Reported by Kalthor <kalthor@interia.pl>)

2012-02-11 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	* infoview.c: reduce flicker by clearing lines incrementally on a
	  scrolling event

2012-02-10 Tim Marston <tim@ed.am>

	* speedbox.c: rewrote code to display end-of-lesson speed and
	  information and pulled it out in to a new file.

2012-02-10 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* banner.c/h: put banner() in its own file so that it can be used
	  in infoview.c
	* infoview.c: display banner at top, use banner colors for scrollbar

2011-11-05 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* utf8.c use MultiByteToWideChar() also in utf8len() on minGW
	  (this fixes problems with ru.typ on minGW)

2011-11-04 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* utf8.c: use MultiByteToWideChar() in widen() on Windows. This will
	  convert to two-byte wchar_t which is what minGW + PDCurses support

2011-10-30 Tim Marston <edam@waxworlds.org>

	* gtypist.c, utf8.c/h, cursmenu.c: get_widech() uses ints to avoid
	  using wint_t, which is broken on Windows. Also, simplified reading
	  characters so that get_widech() is always used. It also now
	  handles windows newline characters for us.

2011-10-26 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c, utf8.c/h: add get_widech() wrapper which
	  calls getch() or get_wch() depending on whether it's a UTF8
          console or not => fixes input problems with KOI8-R terminals
	* script.c, gtypist.c: try to read (convertFromUTF8()) the whole
	  lesson at the very beginning, in order to terminate at the very
          beginning in the case of conversion errors (and not in the middle
	  of typing)

2011-10-24 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* gtypist.c, utf8.c/h: use convertFromUTF8() instead of widen()
	  for Y/N and R/N/E. add towideupper() and iswideupper() helper
	  functions that do they right thing depending on whether it's
	  a UTF8 terminal or an 8bit-terminal

2011-10-22 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* *.c, *.h: make gtypist run on non-utf8 locales with
	  international lessons
	* gtypist.c: add RETURN_CHARACTER (unicode symbol to designate
	  newlines that must be typed)

2011-10-14 Tim Marston <edam@waxworlds.org>

	* gtypist.c, cursmenu.c, script.h: minor fixes to get gtypist to
	  build under MinGW
	* gtypist.c: removed call to MessageBeep() on windows, since it just
	  corrupts the stack! Currently we don't beep on error on windows, as
	  sending ASCII_BELL to the terminal just pauses and does no "bell".

2011-08-07 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* utf8.c: new wchar_t* widen(char*) helper function
	* gtypist.c: widen the YN and RNE strings, but their usage isn't yet
	  fixed

2011-07-08 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>

	* utf8.c, utf8.h: use proper #define before #include for cchar_t
	  (needed for wide character output)

2011-02-28  Tim Marston <edam@waxworlds.org>

	* gtypist.c: rewrote the code to open a script file and check for the
	  presence of HOME environment variable (required for the bestlog) so
	  that it should work on Windows platforms when HOME is not present.

2011-02-26  Tim Marston <edam@waxworlds.org>

	* gtypist.c: added best-score tracking feature and re-wrote some of the
	  speed calculation/display code to always work with CPM (which are
	  saved in the bestlog) and convert to WPM only at display-time.

2011-01-03  Tim Marston <edam@waxworlds.org>

	* gtypist.c: fixed a bug where pressing escape during wait_user()
	  caused seek_label() to be called, but get_script_line() was never re-
	  called. This meant that the previously buffered next script line
	  (from before the seek) would still get executed. wait_user() now
	  treats escape as a "continue" character for all but tutorial prompts,
	  which now handle the seek properly by calling get_script_line().

2009-02-19  Paul Goins  <general@vultaire.net>

	* gtypist.c: Re-fixed the rounding bug by adding a function which
	  compares floats using sprintf-based rounding.  (Bug re-reported by
	  Jakub Gedeon.)

2009-02-04  Paul Goins  <general@vultaire.net>

	* gtypist.c: (display_speed): Fixed long-standing bug where gtypist
	  would display that an error rate of =< 3.0% is needed, but the
	  displayed error rate would sometimes be 3.0% due to rounding.  (Now
	  we use floor() to always round down and avoid this.)
	  (Error reported by Ali Gundaz)

2008-05-17  Paul Goins  <general@vultaire.net>

	* gtypist.c (display_speed): Changed maximum speed to 9999.99.  CPM
	  mode could go into 4 digits for really, really fast typists.

2008-05-12  Paul Goins  <general@vultaire.net>

	* cursmenu.c, gtypist.c, script.h: Updated copyright notices.
	* gtypist.c: Bug fix: --banner-colour, the alternate option for
	  --banner-colours, changed to --banner-colors.

2008-05-07  Paul Goins  <general@vultaire.net>

	* gtypist.c: Bug fix: added "break;" for "--scoring" case

2008-05-06  Paul Goins  <general@vultaire.net>

	* gtypist.c: Added switch for "characters-per-minute" mode.  This
	  is pretty much cosmetic since "words" are standardized to 5
	  characters, but some countries tend to use CPM instead of WPM.
	  However, speeds will top out at 999.99 CPM (200 WPM).
